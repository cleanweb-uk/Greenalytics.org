<h1 class="welcome">Data</h1>
<p>The calculations in Greenalytics are approximations and are based in a number of assumptions. The data used are based on the following references:</p><br/><br/>
<h2>Electricity:</h2>
<p>Greenalytics uses CO2 electricity factors from <a href="http://carma.org">carma.org</a> through their API.</p>
<p>For internet server and infrastructure a global electricity average is used.</p>
<h2>Visitor computers:</h2>
<p>We assume that users use a mix between laptops and desktops: 45 per cent using laptops consuming 19W and 55 per cent using desktops consuming 60W. The consumption information comes from Ecoinvent database and the 45/55 distribution from IDC. 2008. Worldwide Quarterly PC Tracker. www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=IDC_P20</p>
<p>We only include the time the user is active in the website for the electricity consumption. We assume that all electricity use of that laptop during that time is used for browsing that website. The life cycle energy use of the computer (for instance production) is not included</p>
<h2>Servers and Internet infrastructure:</h2>
<p>The server and internet infrastructure is calculated from an approximation to the data traffic.</p>
<p>The energy use for 9Wh/GB is taken from <%= link_to "this report", "http://extra.ivf.se/ecocomputer/downloads/Eup%20Lot%203%20Final%20Report%20070913%20published.pdf"%></p>
<p>Right now a global carbon factor for electricity is used for the servers and infrastructure.</p>
